🔑 Core Principles
Principle	Description
Clarity & Specificity	Be exact in your request. Ambiguity reduces quality. Define scope/output.
Context Engineering	Provide background, goal, structure. Use layers of detail for depth.
Cognitive Load Mgmt	Break complex tasks into steps. Add examples and flows for guidance.

💡 Well-engineered prompts reduce time, boost accuracy, and minimize iteration.

🧠 Advanced Techniques
Technique	Description	Sample Prompt
Chain-of-Thought	Step-by-step reasoning	“Let’s solve this step by step…”
Few-Shot Learning	Multiple examples as guidance	“Here are 3 examples. Now continue the pattern…”
Role-Based Prompting	Assign expertise to AI	“You are a senior ML engineer. Analyze this pipeline…”
Constraint-Based	Force structure or tone	“Explain this in exactly 100 words. Avoid technical terms.”
Iterative Refinement	Build progressively	“First, outline. Then expand. Then review.”

🎯 Blend multiple techniques for precision, control, and clarity.

📐 Prompt Structures
⭐ STAR Framework
Situation – Context

Task – Objective

Action – Approach

Result – Outcome

📄 CLEAR Template
Context – What’s happening?

Limitations – Constraints

Examples – Show patterns

Action – What should AI do?

Result – Desired output

🧠 SPADE Model
Situation → Problem → Analysis → Decision → Execution

🧰 Pick frameworks based on your task: STAR (strategic), CLEAR (technical), SPADE (analytical).

🏗️ Domain-Specific Prompting
Domain	Role-Based Prompt Example
👨‍💻 Technical (MLOps)	

txt
Copy
Edit
You are a senior MLOps engineer.  
Design a pipeline that:
- Streams from Kafka
- Detects data drift and retrains
- Serves via REST API  
Constraints: Python, 99.9% uptime, 10K req/sec  
Output: Architecture + Tools + Code + Deployment Plan
| ✍️ Creative Writing |

Edit
You are a sci-fi author.  
Write a short story:  
- Mars colony, 2157  
- Terraforming failure  
- Theme: Environmental ethics  
Style: Speculative fiction, technical depth
| 📈 Business Strategy |

txt
Copy
Edit
Act as a McKinsey partner.  
Client: $2B retailer, -15% YoY  
Deliver:
- SWOT
- Porter's 5 Forces
- Strategic options (3)
- 6-month roadmap
🔍 Tailor language, roles, and format to each industry for best results.

🌀 Meta-Prompting
Meta-Method	Description	Example Prompt
Self-Correction	Ask AI to refine itself	“Review the above. Identify and fix flaws.”
Perspective Shift	View from multiple lenses	“Explain this from a policymaker, citizen, and activist view. Synthesize a policy.”
Quality Checklists	Apply evaluation criteria	“Score this blog on tone, clarity, CTA, readability. Then improve it.”

⚙️ Meta-prompts improve accuracy, objectivity, and output polish.

📊 Evaluation & Optimization
🧪 Prompt Testing Workflow
Baseline – Test prompt 5–10 times

Variants – Tweak structure, tone, constraints

Scoring Criteria:

✅ Accuracy

🎨 Creativity

🧩 Completeness

📌 Relevance

🔁 Consistency

🔄 Optimization Example
Before:
“Write about climate change.”

After:

txt
Copy
Edit
You are a climate scientist. Write an 800-word article:  
- Explain greenhouse effect (2 analogies)  
- Include 3 IPCC stats  
- Address 2 myths  
- Suggest 4 practical solutions  
Audience: Grade 8  
Tone: Hopeful, no jargon

✅ Best Practices Summary
✅ Do
Define output structure

Provide relevant context & examples

Use constraints and roles

Break complex asks into parts

Iterate & test multiple versions

❌ Don’t
Assume background knowledge

Mix too many goals

Skip examples or limits

Expect perfect answers in one shot

🎓 Final Thoughts
Prompting is system design.
Approach it with rigor, structure, and creative iteration.

Refine prompts like code.
Test them like products.
Scale them like strategy.
