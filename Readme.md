🔑 Core Principles
Prompt engineering is about making your instructions clear, specific, and effective. Here are the global best practices:

Principle	Description
Clarity & Specificity	Be precise. Ambiguity weakens output. Use detailed language to guide the AI.
Context Engineering	Add background, goals, and structure. Layer detail for full understanding.
Cognitive Load Mgmt	Break down tasks. Use examples and flows to avoid overwhelming the model.
Iterative Design	Start simple and refine based on outputs. Prompts evolve like code.
💡 Well-engineered prompts reduce time, boost accuracy, and minimize iteration.

🧠 Advanced Techniques
Build on the basics with these advanced techniques. Combine them for best results:

Technique	Description	Sample Prompt Example
Chain-of-Thought	Step-by-step logic to improve reasoning.	"Let’s solve this step by step..."
Few-Shot Learning	Provide examples to guide the model.	"Here are 3 samples. Now continue..."
Role-Based Prompting	Assign expertise for tailored responses.	"You are a senior ML engineer..."
Constraint-Based	Enforce rules like length or style.	"Explain in 100 words. No jargon."
Iterative Refinement	Build in stages for progressive output.	"Start with outline. Then expand."
Zero-Shot Prompting	No examples; rely on model's knowledge.	"Classify this text as positive or negative."
Tree-of-Thoughts	Explore multiple reasoning paths.	"Consider three possible solutions and evaluate each."
Self-Consistency	Generate multiple responses and select the best.	"Generate 5 answers and pick the most consistent."
Retrieval-Augmented Generation	Incorporate external data for accuracy.	"Using the provided context, answer the question."
🎯 Combine techniques for precision, clarity, and creativity.

📐 Prompt Structures
Use structured frameworks to organize prompts systematically:

⭐ STAR Framework
S → Situation: Context
T → Task: Objective
A → Action: Approach
R → Result: Outcome
📄 CLEAR Template
C → Context
L → Limitations
E → Examples
A → Action
R → Result
🧠 SPADE Model
S → Situation
P → Problem
A → Analysis
D → Decision
E → Execution
🛠️ BAB Framework (Before-After-Bridge)
B → Before: Describe the current state
A → After: Desired outcome
B → Bridge: How to get there
🧰 Pick frameworks by task: STAR (strategic), CLEAR (technical), SPADE (analytical), BAB (storytelling/marketing).

🏗️ Domain-Specific Prompting
Tailor prompts to industries for relevant outputs:

Domain	Example
Technical (MLOps)	You are a senior MLOps engineer. Design a pipeline that: streams from Kafka, detects data drift, retrains models, serves via REST API. Constraints: Python, 99.9% uptime, 10K req/sec. Output: Architecture + Tools + Code + Deployment Plan
Creative Writing	You are a sci-fi author. Write a story: Mars colony, 2157, terraforming failure, theme: environmental ethics. Style: Speculative fiction with technical depth.
Business Strategy	Act as a McKinsey partner. Client: $2B retailer, -15% YoY. Deliver: SWOT, Porter’s 5 Forces, 3 Strategic Options, 6-Month Roadmap.
Healthcare	You are a diagnostician. Given symptoms: fever, cough, fatigue. Suggest possible diagnoses, tests, and treatments. Cite medical guidelines.
Finance	You are a financial analyst. Analyze stock: AAPL. Provide: P/E ratio, growth forecast, risk assessment. Output: Buy/Sell recommendation with rationale.
Legal	You are a contract lawyer. Review this clause: [insert clause]. Identify risks, suggest revisions. Ensure compliance with GDPR.
🔍 Adapt tone, roles, and output to your field for best results.

🌀 Meta-Prompting
Layer prompts to enhance self-awareness and refinement:

Meta-Method	Description	Example
Self-Correction	Ask AI to review itself	"Review the above. Identify and fix flaws."
Perspective Shift	Multi-role lens	"Explain this from 3 viewpoints. Synthesize policy."
Quality Checklists	Apply criteria	"Score this article on tone, clarity, CTA, and improve it."
Self-Ask	Prompt the AI to question itself	"Before answering, ask clarifying questions."
⚙️ Meta-prompts increase objectivity, depth, and polish.

📊 Evaluation & Optimization
Refine prompts through systematic testing:

🧪 Testing Workflow
Baseline — Try prompt 5–10 times
Variants — Adjust tone, structure, or constraints
Score Output by:
✅ Accuracy
🎨 Creativity
🧩 Completeness
📌 Relevance
🔁 Consistency
A/B Testing — Compare versions for metrics like response quality
🔄 Example Optimization
❌ Before:
Write about climate change.

✅ After:
You are a climate scientist. Write an 800-word article:

Explain greenhouse effect (2 analogies)
Include 3 IPCC stats
Address 2 myths
Suggest 4 practical solutions Audience: Grade 8 Tone: Hopeful, no jargon
🧩 Advanced Examples
🏢 Business Strategy
Client: SaaS firm, $50M ARR, entering EU
Deliverables: Market Scan, Competitive SWOT, GTM Plan, ROI Model, 6-Month Execution Roadmap
🤖 ML System Design
Use Case: Radiology image classifier
Requirements: 10K+ images/day, ≥95% accuracy, explainability, HIPAA compliance
Structure: Architecture → Dataset → Model → Eval → Deployment
🌍 Social Innovation
Problem: Urban food waste
Method: Design Thinking
Deliverables: Personas, Journey Maps, Problem/Solution Fits, MVP Test Ideas
📚 Education
You are a history teacher. Create a lesson plan:
Topic: World War II
Grade: 10
Include: Timeline, key figures, interactive activity
Output: Objectives, materials, assessment
✅ Best Practices Summary
Do:
📦 Define output format (e.g., JSON, bullet points)
🧠 Provide examples & context
🔒 Add constraints & roles
🪜 Break tasks into parts
🔁 Test multiple versions
📏 Use delimiters like """ or XML for structure
🔄 Leverage the latest models for better results
Don’t:
❗ Assume prior knowledge
🌀 Combine too many goals
🧩 Skip examples or limits
💭 Expect perfect on first try
🗣️ Use vague language
🚫 Overload with unnecessary details
