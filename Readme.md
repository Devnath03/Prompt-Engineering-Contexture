## Core Principles

Master these fundamental principles to create effective prompts that consistently deliver high-quality results from AI systems.

### 1. Clarity & Specificity
- Be explicit about what you want: Vague requests lead to vague responses.
- Define the scope: Set clear boundaries for the task.
- Specify the format: Tell the AI exactly how to structure the output.

### 2. Context Engineering
- Provide relevant background: Give the AI the context it needs.
- Set the scene: Establish environment, constraints, and objectives.
- Use progressive disclosure: Build complexity gradually.

### 3. Cognitive Load Management
- Break complex tasks into steps: Use chain-of-thought reasoning.
- Provide examples: Show, don't just tell.
- Use structured thinking: Guide the AI logically.

> 💡 **Key Insight**  
> The quality of your prompt directly correlates with the quality of the AI's response. Investing time in clarity, specificity, and context will significantly improve your results and reduce the need for multiple iterations.

## Advanced Techniques

These sophisticated methods help you unlock the full potential of AI systems:

### 1. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting
Forces the AI to show its reasoning step-by-step for accuracy and transparency.

**Example:**  
```
Solve this problem step by step:
A company's revenue increased by 25% in Q1, then decreased by 15% in Q2. 
If the final revenue is $127,500, what was the initial revenue?

Think through this step by step:
1. Define variables
2. Set up equations
3. Solve systematically
4. Verify the answer
```

### 2. Few-Shot Learning with Examples
Provide several examples to establish patterns and expectations.

**Example:**  
```
Transform the following sentences into active voice. Here are examples:

Passive: "The report was written by Sarah."
Active: "Sarah wrote the report."

Passive: "The meeting will be attended by all managers."
Active: "All managers will attend the meeting."

Now transform: "The decision was made by the board of directors."
```

### 3. Role-Based Prompting
Assign the AI a specific expertise or persona to leverage domain knowledge.

**Example:**  
```
You are a senior software architect with 15 years of experience in distributed systems. 
Design a system architecture for a real-time collaborative document editing platform 
that supports 100,000 concurrent users.
```

### 4. Constraint-Based Prompting
Use specific requirements to focus the AI's output.

**Example:**  
```
Write a product description for a smartphone with these constraints:
- Exactly 150 words
- Target: tech-savvy millennials
- Mention 3 key features
- Conversational tone
- Include one emotional appeal
- End with a call-to-action
- Avoid technical jargon
```

### 5. Iterative Refinement
Build complexity through rounds of interaction.

**Example:**  
1. Create a basic outline  
2. Expand with examples  
3. Add counterarguments  
4. Suggest visuals

> 🎯 **Pro Tip:**  
> Combine techniques for maximum effectiveness (e.g., role-based + chain-of-thought + constraints).

## Prompt Structures

Frameworks for organizing prompts and ensuring comprehensive coverage:

### STAR Framework
- **Situation:** Context or scenario
- **Task:** Objective or challenge
- **Action:** Steps taken or plan
- **Result:** Outcome or deliverable

**Example:**  
Situation: You're a marketing consultant for a struggling restaurant  
Task: Develop a strategy to increase foot traffic by 40%  
Action: Plan digital marketing, partnerships, retention  
Result: 6-month roadmap with metrics

### CLEAR Template
- **Context:** Background information
- **Limitations:** Constraints (budget, resources)
- **Examples:** Reference points
- **Action:** What needs to be done
- **Result:** Desired output

**Example:**  
Context: Developing a habit tracking app  
Limitations: $50K budget, 4 months, 3 devs  
Examples: Habitica, Todoist  
Action: Product requirements doc  
Result: User stories, tech specs, phases

### SPADE Method
- **Situation:** Environment/state
- **Problem:** Challenge faced
- **Analysis:** Reasoning/diagnosis
- **Decision:** Recommendation/solution
- **Execution:** Implementation plan

**Example:**  
Situation: E-commerce with 30% cart abandonment  
Problem: Checkout drop-off  
Analysis: Identify friction points  
Decision: Recommend UX improvements  
Execution: Roadmap with priorities

> 📝 **Framework Selection Guide:**  
> - Use **STAR** for strategies/consulting  
> - Use **CLEAR** for technical/product  
> - Use **SPADE** for analytical/decision-making

## Domain-Specific Prompting

Tailor your approach for different fields:

### Technical/Programming

```
You are a senior Python developer specializing in data engineering and MLOps.

Task: Design a data pipeline that:
- Ingests streaming data from Kafka
- Performs real-time feature engineering
- Triggers model retraining on data drift
- Serves predictions via REST API

Requirements:
- Python ecosystem tools
- 99.9% uptime
- 10K req/sec
- Monitoring/alerting

Format:  
1. Architecture overview  
2. Tech stack/justification  
3. Code skeleton  
4. Deployment considerations  
5. Monitoring strategy
```

### Creative Writing

```
You are an award-winning sci-fi author.

Create a short story (1500-2000 words):
- Setting: Mars colony in 2157
- Protagonist: Terraforming engineer with an ethical dilemma
- Conflict: Discovery threatening survival
- Themes: Environmental responsibility, adaptation, hubris
- Style: Literary sci-fi, technical accuracy
- Ending: Ambiguous but hopeful
```

## Meta-Prompting

Advanced techniques enabling AI to evaluate, correct, and improve its own outputs:

### Self-Correction Prompts

**Example:**  
Analyze the following argument for logical fallacies, weak evidence, or bias.  
Rewrite to address these, and explain improvements.

### Perspective-Taking

**Example:**  
Present three perspectives on AI replacing workers:
1. Displaced worker  
2. Tech CEO  
3. Economist  

For each:
- Core concerns
- Reasoning
- Validity
- Common ground

Synthesize into a balanced policy recommendation.

### Quality Assurance Prompting

**Example:**  
Evaluate a marketing email using a checklist:
- Clear value proposition
- Compelling subject line
- Personalized messaging
- Strong call-to-action
- Mobile-responsive design
- Spam optimization
- A/B testing
- Compliance

Provide:
1. Score for each element
2. Improvement suggestions
3. Rewritten version
4. A/B recommendations
