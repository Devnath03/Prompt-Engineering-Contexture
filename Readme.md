🔑 Core Principles
🔍 Clarity & Specificity

Be exact in your ask—vagueness reduces response quality.

Define scope, constraints, and output format.

🧱 Context Engineering

Supply background, goals, and structure.

Use progressive complexity for nuanced tasks.

🧠 Cognitive Load Management

Break down tasks with step-by-step reasoning.

Provide examples and logical flows.

💡 Well-crafted prompts save time, improve accuracy, and reduce iteration cycles.

🧠 Advanced Techniques
Technique	Description	Sample
Chain-of-Thought	Force AI to reason step-by-step	“Think step by step before solving…”
Few-Shot Learning	Guide via multiple examples	“Here are 3 examples. Now complete this one…”
Role-Based Prompting	Assign expert persona to AI	“You are a senior ML engineer. Solve…”
Constraint-Based Prompting	Guide output style, tone, length	“In exactly 100 words, using no jargon…”
Iterative Refinement	Build answers progressively	Outline → Expand → Review → Finalize

🎯 Combine methods for maximum control and effectiveness.

📐 Prompt Structures
⭐ STAR Framework
Situation: Background

Task: Objective

Action: Plan/steps

Result: Outcome

📄 CLEAR Template
Context: What’s going on

Limitations: Constraints

Examples: Reference cases

Action: Task

Result: Deliverable

🧠 SPADE Model
Situation → Problem → Analysis → Decision → Execution

🧰 Choose frameworks based on task type: STAR for strategy, CLEAR for technical docs, SPADE for decisions.

🏗️ Domain-Specific Prompting
👨‍💻 Technical (ML / DevOps)

Edit
You are a senior MLOps engineer. 
Design a data pipeline that:
- Streams data from Kafka
- Detects drift & retrains model
- Serves predictions via REST API
Constraints: 99.9% uptime, 10k req/sec, use Python
Deliver: Architecture + Tools + Code + Deployment Plan
✍️ Creative Writing
txt
Copy
Edit
You are a literary sci-fi author.
Write a short story:
- Setting: Mars colony, 2157
- Conflict: Terraforming gone wrong
- Theme: Environmental ethics
- Style: Speculative fiction with technical depth
📈 Business Analysis
txt
Copy
Edit
Act as a McKinsey partner.
Client: $2B retailer, -15% YoY
Deliver:
- SWOT
- Porter's Five Forces
- Strategic options (3)
- 6-month roadmap
🔍 Adapt your prompt language to domain-specific frameworks, roles, and jargon.

🌀 Meta-Prompting
🔁 Self-Correction
“Review the response above. Identify any fallacies, biases, or errors. Revise with improvements.”

👥 Perspective Shifting
“Explain this issue from 3 viewpoints: policymaker, citizen, activist. Then synthesize a policy recommendation.”

✅ Quality Checklists
“Evaluate the ad below using these 6 criteria (e.g., CTA, clarity, tone, relevance, readability, mobile optimization). Score and revise.”

⚙️ Use meta-prompts to enhance accuracy, objectivity, and polish.

📊 Evaluation & Optimization
🔬 Prompt Testing Workflow
Baseline: Run prompt 5–10 times

Variants: Change phrasing, constraints, examples

Scoring Metrics:

Accuracy ✅

Creativity 🎨

Completeness 🧩

Relevance 📌

Consistency 🔁

📈 Optimization Example
Before:
"Write about climate change."

After:

txt
Copy
Edit
You are a climate scientist. Write an 800-word article:
- Explain the greenhouse effect using 2 analogies
- Present 3 data points from IPCC
- Address 2 common myths
- Suggest 4 practical actions
Audience: 8th-grade, hopeful tone, avoid jargon
🧩 Advanced Examples
🏢 Business Strategy
Client: SaaS, $50M ARR, EU expansion

Deliverables: Market scan, competitive SWOT, GTM plan, ROI model, 6-month roadmap

🤖 ML System Design
Use case: Radiology image classifier

Needs: 10k+ images/day, 95% accuracy, explainability, HIPAA compliance

Sections: Architecture → Dataset → Model → Evaluation → Deployment

🌍 Social Innovation
Problem: Urban food waste

Method: Design Thinking

Outputs: Personas, journey maps, solutions, MVP tests

✅ Best Practices Summary
✅ Do
Set output format & structure

Provide relevant context & examples

Use constraints, roles, and evaluation criteria

Break complex tasks into parts

Iterate based on results

❌ Don’t
Assume background knowledge

Overload with multiple goals

Skip examples or boundaries

Expect perfect output in one shot

🚀 Advanced Tips
Ask AI to reflect, score, improve

Use multiple methods in tandem

Build a prompt library of successful patterns

Align prompts to model strengths (e.g., CoT for reasoning tasks)

🎓 Final Thoughts
Effective prompting isn’t just asking the right question—it’s engineering the entire interaction.
Approach it like system design: with rigor, structure, and creative experimentation.

🧠 Prompting is a skill. Refine it like code. Test it like product. Scale it like strategy.
