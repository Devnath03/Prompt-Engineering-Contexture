🔑 Core Principles
Prompt engineering fundamentals revolve around making your instructions clear and effective. Here are the core principles:

PrincipleDescriptionClarity & SpecificityBe precise. Ambiguity weakens output. Use detailed language to guide the AI exactly where you want it to go.Context EngineeringAdd background, goals, structure. Layer detail to help the model understand the task fully.Cognitive Load MgmtBreak down tasks. Use examples and flows to avoid overwhelming the model.Iterative DesignStart simple and refine based on outputs. Prompts evolve like code.
💡 Well-engineered prompts reduce time, boost accuracy, and minimize iteration.
🧠 Advanced Techniques
Build on basics with these techniques to handle complex tasks. Combine them for better results.

TechniqueDescriptionSampleChain-of-ThoughtStep-by-step logic to improve reasoning."Let’s solve this step by step..."Few-Shot LearningProvide examples to guide the model."Here are 3 samples. Now continue..."Role-Based PromptingAssign expertise for tailored responses."You are a senior ML engineer..."Constraint-BasedEnforce rules like length or style."Explain in 100 words. No jargon."Iterative RefinementBuild in stages for progressive output."Start with outline. Then expand."Zero-Shot PromptingNo examples; rely on model's knowledge."Classify this text as positive or negative."Tree-of-ThoughtsExplore multiple reasoning paths."Consider three possible solutions and evaluate each."Self-ConsistencyGenerate multiple responses and select the best."Generate 5 answers and pick the most consistent."Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)Incorporate external data for accuracy."Using the provided context, answer the question."
🎯 Combine techniques for precision, clarity, and creativity.
📐 Prompt Structures
Use structured frameworks to organize prompts systematically.

⭐ STAR Framework
S → Situation: Context

T → Task: Objective

A → Action: Approach

R → Result: Outcome


📄 CLEAR Template
C → Context

L → Limitations

E → Examples

A → Action

R → Result


🧠 SPADE Model
S → Situation

P → Problem

A → Analysis

D → Decision

E → Execution


🛠️ BAB Framework (Before-After-Bridge)
B → Before: Describe the current state

A → After: Desired outcome

B → Bridge: How to get there

(Added for storytelling or marketing prompts)

🧰 Pick frameworks by task: STAR (strategic), CLEAR (technical), SPADE (analytical).
🏗️ Domain-Specific Prompting
Tailor prompts to industries for relevant outputs.

DomainExample👨‍💻 Technical (MLOps)You are a senior MLOps engineer. Design a pipeline that: - Streams from Kafka - Detects data drift - Retrains models - Serves via REST API Constraints: Python, 99.9% uptime, 10K req/sec Output: Architecture + Tools + Code + Deployment Plan✍️ Creative WritingYou are a sci-fi author. Write a story: - Mars colony, 2157 - Terraforming failure - Theme: Environmental ethics Style: Speculative fiction with technical depth📈 Business StrategyAct as a McKinsey partner. Client: $2B retailer, -15% YoY Deliver: - SWOT - Porter’s 5 Forces - 3 Strategic Options - 6-Month Roadmap🩺 HealthcareYou are a diagnostician. Given symptoms: fever, cough, fatigue. Suggest possible diagnoses, tests, and treatments. Cite medical guidelines.💰 FinanceYou are a financial analyst. Analyze stock: AAPL. Provide: - P/E ratio - Growth forecast - Risk assessment Output: Buy/Sell recommendation with rationale.⚖️ LegalYou are a contract lawyer. Review this clause: [insert clause]. Identify risks, suggest revisions. Ensure compliance with GDPR.

🔍 Adapt tone, roles, and output to your field for best results.

🌀 Meta-Prompting
Layer prompts to enhance self-awareness and refinement.

Meta-MethodDescriptionExampleSelf-CorrectionAsk AI to review itself"Review the above. Identify and fix flaws."Perspective ShiftMulti-role lens"Explain this from 3 viewpoints. Synthesize policy."Quality ChecklistsApply criteria"Score this article on tone, clarity, CTA, and improve it."Self-AskPrompt the AI to question itself"Before answering, ask clarifying questions."

⚙️ Meta-prompts increase objectivity, depth, and polish.

📊 Evaluation & Optimization
Refine prompts through systematic testing.
🧪 Testing Workflow

Baseline — Try prompt 5–10 times
Variants — Adjust tone, structure, or constraints
Score Output by:

✅ Accuracy
🎨 Creativity
🧩 Completeness
📌 Relevance
🔁 Consistency


A/B Testing — Compare versions for metrics like response quality.

✅ Best Practices Summary
✅ Do:

📦 Define output format (e.g., JSON, bullet points)
🧠 Provide examples & context
🔒 Add constraints & roles
🪜 Break tasks into parts
🔁 Test multiple versions
📏 Use delimiters like """ or XML for structure
🔄 Leverage the latest models for better results

❌ Don’t:

❗ Assume prior knowledge
🌀 Combine too many goals
🧩 Skip examples or limits
💭 Expect perfect on first try
🗣️ Use vague language
🚫 Overload with unnecessary details

🎓 Final Thoughts
Prompting is system design. Approach it like code: ✍️ Refactor regularly, ✅ Test thoroughly, 📈 Scale strategically.
As a beginner, start with simple prompts and experiment. Resources like OpenAI's guide or PromptingGuide.ai can deepen your knowledge.
