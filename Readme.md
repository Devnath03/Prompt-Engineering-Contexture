🔑#  Core Principles
Principle	Description
Clarity & Specificity	Be precise. Ambiguity weakens output.
Context Engineering	Add background, goals, structure. Layer detail.
Cognitive Load Mgmt	Break down tasks. Use examples and flows.

💡 Well-engineered prompts reduce time, boost accuracy, and minimize iteration.

🧠 # Advanced Techniques
Technique	Description	Sample
Chain-of-Thought	Step-by-step logic	"Let’s solve this step by step..."
Few-Shot Learning	Provide examples	"Here are 3 samples. Now continue..."
Role-Based Prompting	Assign expertise	"You are a senior ML engineer..."
Constraint-Based	Enforce rules	"Explain in 100 words. No jargon."
Iterative Refinement	Build in stages	"Start with outline. Then expand."

🎯 Combine techniques for precision, clarity, and creativity.

🏗️ Domain-Specific Prompting
# Domain	Example
👨‍💻 Technical (MLOps)	


# You are a senior MLOps engineer.  
Design a pipeline that:  
- Streams from Kafka  
- Detects data drift  
- Retrains models  
- Serves via REST API  
Constraints: Python, 99.9% uptime, 10K req/sec  
Output: Architecture + Tools + Code + Deployment Plan  
``` |
| ✍️ **Creative Writing** |  

You are a sci-fi author.  
Write a story:  
- Mars colony, 2157  
- Terraforming failure  
- Theme: Environmental ethics  
Style: Speculative fiction with technical depth  

| 📈 **Business Strategy** |  

Act as a McKinsey partner.  
Client: $2B retailer, -15% YoY  
Deliver:  
- SWOT  
- Porter’s 5 Forces  
- 3 Strategic Options  
- 6-Month Roadmap  
``` |

> 🔍 *Adapt tone, roles, and output to your field for best results.*

## 🌀 Meta-Prompting

| Meta-Method | Description | Example |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| **Self-Correction** | Ask AI to review itself | `"Review the above. Identify and fix flaws."` |
| **Perspective Shift** | Multi-role lens | `"Explain this from 3 viewpoints. Synthesize policy."` |
| **Quality Checklists** | Apply criteria | `"Score this article on tone, clarity, CTA, and improve it."` |

> ⚙️ *Meta-prompts increase objectivity, depth, and polish.*

## 📊 Evaluation & Optimization

### 🧪 Testing Workflow
1. **Baseline** — Try prompt 5–10 times  
2. **Variants** — Adjust tone, structure, or constraints  
3. **Score Output** by:  
   - ✅ Accuracy  
   - 🎨 Creativity  
   - 🧩 Completeness  
   - 📌 Relevance  
   - 🔁 Consistency  

### 🔄 Example Optimization

**❌ Before**  
> `"Write about climate change."`

**✅ After**  

You are a climate scientist.  
Write an 800-word article:  
- Explain greenhouse effect (2 analogies)  
- Include 3 IPCC stats  
- Address 2 myths  
- Suggest 4 practical solutions  
Audience: Grade 8  
Tone: Hopeful, no jargon
